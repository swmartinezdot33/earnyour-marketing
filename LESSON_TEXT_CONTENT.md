## Module 1: Introduction - Text Content

### Lesson 1.1: What is Google My Business?

**Overview:**
Google My Business (now called Google Business Profile) is your gateway to local visibility. It's the free tool that controls how your business appears in three critical places:
1. Google Search results
2. Google Maps
3. Google Reviews

**Key Facts:**
- It's completely free
- You have full control
- It directly impacts your visibility
- It's essential for local businesses

**Why It Matters:**
When someone searches for your business or service nearby, they see YOUR information directly from your profile. If your profile is optimized, they call. If it's not, they go to your competitors.

**The Three Displays:**
1. **Google Search** - Shows your business name, rating, reviews, phone, website
2. **Google Maps** - Shows your location, photos, hours, directions
3. **Google Reviews** - Shows all customer reviews and your responses

**Control:**
You decide what information customers see. You control:
- Your business name
- Your description
- Your photos
- Your hours
- Your services
- Your responses to reviews
- Your posts

**Getting Started:**
The foundation of your entire local marketing strategy starts with claiming and optimizing your Google My Business profile. Everything else builds on top of this.

**The 2026 Reality:**
In 2026, Google My Business is not optional—it's essential. Every local business needs:

- Customer reviews
- Professional responses

**Your Advantage:**
If you implement the strategy in this course while your competitors ignore GMB, you'll dominate your local market.

## Module 2: Claiming & Verification - Text Content

### Lesson 2.1: Finding Your Business on Google

**How This Works:**

Google automatically discovers businesses from across the web:
- Local directories
- Maps
- Reviews sites
- Business websites
- Phone books

This means your business likely already has a listing on Google, even if you never created one.

**Your Task:**
Find your existing listing (or create a new one) and claim it.

**The Finding Process:**

1. **Go to google.com/business**
2. **Sign in** with your Google account (create one if needed)
3. **Type your business name**
4. **Google searches for matches**
5. **Review results**
6. **Claim the correct one**

**What Google Shows You:**
- Your business name
- Your address
- Your phone number
- Your existing reviews (if any)
- Your category
- Any existing information

**If You See Multiple Listings:**
This is common. Choose the most accurate one. Only claim ONE listing per location.

**If You Don't See Your Business:**
Click "Create a new business" and enter:
- Business name
- Address (or service area)
- Category
- Phone number
- Website (optional)

**Next Step:**
Once you find or create your listing, you'll verify it. That's what the next lesson covers.

### Lesson 2.2: Claiming & Verification - The Complete Process

**Verification Methods:**

Google wants to ensure you actually own the business, so they require verification through one of these methods:

**Option 1: Postcard (Most Common)**
- Google mails you a PIN code
- Takes 2-3 weeks
- You enter the PIN in your account
- Works when other methods aren't available

**Option 2: Phone (Fastest if available)**
- Google calls you
- You answer or listen to voicemail
- Receive PIN code
- Instant (or within hours)
- Fastest option

**Option 3: Email (Fast if available)**
- Google emails you a PIN
- You enter it in your account
- Instant
- Second fastest option

**The Verification Process:**

1. **Choose your method** (phone/email/postcard)
2. **Confirm details** (phone number, email address)
3. **Wait for verification code**
4. **Enter the code** in your GMB account
5. **Boom** - You're verified!

**After Verification:**

Once you see the green checkmark next to your business name, you have FULL access to:
- Edit your profile
- Add photos
- Respond to reviews
- Post content
- Manage messages
- View analytics
- Manage Q&A

**Why This Matters:**

Verification proves to Google that you own/manage this business. It unlocks all the tools and features that drive results.

**Timeline Expectations:**
- Phone/Email: Same day
- Postcard: 2-3 weeks

**Pro Tip:** Choose phone or email if available for immediate access. If neither is available (some addresses don't qualify), postcard is fine—you'll just have to wait.

## Module 3: Profile Optimization - Text Content

### Lesson 3.1: Business Name & Category Strategy

**Business Name - The Rule:**

Your business name should be your ACTUAL legal business name. Not keywords. Not clever taglines. Your real name.

**Examples:**
- ✅ GOOD: "Joe's Pizza"
- ❌ BAD: "Joe's Pizza - Best Slice in Town"
- ✅ GOOD: "Smith Plumbing"
- ❌ BAD: "Smith's Emergency Plumbing Services Denver"

**Why?**
Google penalizes keyword stuffing. If you try to game it, Google catches you and ranks you WORSE.

**Category Selection - The Strategy:**

Your category tells Google what you do. It's the first signal Google uses to show you to the right people.

**How It Works:**
When someone searches "plumber near me," Google shows businesses with the "Plumber" category.

**Finding Your Category:**

Think about what customers search for:
- "Plumber near me" → Category: Plumber
- "Hair salon near me" → Category: Hair Salon
- "Italian restaurant" → Category: Italian Restaurant
- "Medical doctor" → Category: Physician

**Multiple Categories:**

You can add up to 10 categories. Add all that apply:

Example for a salon:
1. Hair Salon (primary)
2. Barber
3. Nail Salon (if you offer nails)
4. Waxing Salon (if you offer waxing)

More categories = More visibility in more searches.

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Choose categories customers search for**, not what you think you are
2. **Add all relevant categories** (up to 10)
3. **Put primary category first**
4. **Don't add unrelated categories** (Google will catch this)
5. **Update if your services change**

---

### Lesson 3.2: Hours, Contact Info & Website

**Business Hours - Critical Details:**

**Why It Matters:**
When a customer searches for you, the FIRST thing they check is "Are they open right now?"

If your hours are wrong, you lose that customer immediately.

**Setting Hours Correctly:**

1. Enter each day of the week
2. Be honest about your hours
3. If you're closed, mark it as "Closed" (don't omit the day)
4. If you close for lunch, enter that (optional but helpful)

**Example:**
- Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
- Saturday: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM
- Sunday: Closed

**Phone Number - The Right One:**

Use your business phone number, not your personal cell phone.

**Why?**
Google tracks calls from your listing. This data helps Google rank you better. Make sure it's a number you actually answer.

**Email Address - Professional:**

Use a business email if possible:
- ✅ GOOD: info@yourbusiness.com
- ✅ ACCEPTABLE: youremail@gmail.com
- ❌ AVOID: personal emails like "jsmith123@gmail.com"

**Website - The Link:**

If you have a website, add it. Use the full URL:
- ✅ GOOD: https://www.yourbusiness.com
- ❌ BAD: www.yourbusiness.com
- ❌ BAD: yourbusiness.com

**If You Don't Have a Website:**
That's okay. You can skip this field for now. But I'd recommend getting one eventually.

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Keep hours accurate** - Update if you change
2. **Use a business phone** - You'll thank yourself for the tracking data
3. **Check timezone** - Make sure hours are in YOUR timezone
4. **Test it** - Search for your business and verify hours display correctly
5. **Update seasonally** - Different hours in summer/winter? Update them

## Module 4: Visual Assets - Text Content

### Lesson 4.1: Photo Strategy - Why 100+ Photos Change Everything

**The Photo Impact:**

Studies show:
- Businesses with 100+ photos get 50% more calls
- Businesses with <20 photos rarely get calls
- Photo quality matters more than quantity
- Consistent photo updates signal you're active

**The Strategy:**

Instead of uploading 50 photos immediately, post 2-3 per week consistently.

**Why?**
- Google sees consistent activity
- Your profile stays fresh
- You show up in "Recently Updated" searches
- Customers see your business is active

**Timeline to 100+ Photos:**

- **Month 1:** 8-12 photos (your foundation)
- **Month 2:** 16-20 photos (total 24-32)
- **Month 3:** 20+ photos (total 44-52)
- **Month 6:** 50+ new photos (total 100+)

**Quality Requirements:**

Photos should be:
- Clear and sharp (not blurry)
- Well-lit (good natural light)
- Professional appearance
- Recent (within 6 months)
- At least 720x720 pixels
- JPG or PNG format

**Photo Categories:**

Every business needs:
1. **Logo** - Professional headshot
2. **Storefront/Exterior** - Where customers find you
3. **Interior/Workspace** - What it looks like inside
4. **Team** - Make it personal
5. **Work Examples** - Show what you do
6. **Before & After** - Show transformation
7. **Additional** - Services, products, happy customers

**DIY vs Professional:**

- **DIY:** Use your smartphone, natural light, multiple angles
- **Professional:** Hire photographer for initial 20-30 photos (~$300-500)
- **Hybrid:** Professional for foundation, DIY ongoing

**The Mistake People Make:**

Waiting for perfect photos = No photos = No visibility = No leads

**The Right Approach:**

Post good photos NOW. Post perfect photos later.

## Module 5: Reviews - Text Content

### Lesson 5.1: Why Reviews Are Everything

**The Reality:**

Reviews are the #1 ranking factor for Google My Business. More important than:
- Photos
- Business hours
- Website
- Any other factor

**Why?**

Google's algorithm is designed to show the BEST businesses to customers. How does Google know you're the best? Customer reviews.

**The Numbers:**

- 73% check reviews before visiting
- 4.5+ star rating = 2x more calls
- Responding to reviews = 50% more calls
- 100+ reviews = Multiple page 1 positions

**What Reviews Do:**

1. **Prove you're trustworthy** - Real customers say you're good
2. **Improve ranking** - More reviews = Higher ranking
3. **Build social proof** - New customers see others liked you
4. **Show engagement** - Responding shows you care
5. **Generate calls** - Happy customers = More business

**The Problem:**

People don't naturally leave reviews. You have to ask.

**The Solution:**

This course teaches you a system to ask for reviews systematically.

**The Math:**

- Ask 10 customers per month
- 30% conversion rate = 3 reviews per month
- 3 reviews × 12 months = 36 reviews per year
- Result: You dominate your local market

**Your Action:**

Start asking for reviews TODAY. This is the #1 thing you can do to improve your GMB ranking.

## Module 7: Advanced Features - Text Content

### Lessons 7.1-7.2: Advanced Features & Complete Strategy

**Advanced Feature: Q&A (Questions & Answers)**

**What It Is:**
Customers can ask questions about your business on your listing.

**Examples:**
- "Do you offer rush delivery?"
- "What areas do you serve?"
- "How much does this cost?"
- "Do you have Sunday hours?"

**Why It Matters:**
Customer sees question + your answer = They convert without calling.

**Strategy:**
You can even ask yourself questions and answer them.

Common questions customers ask? Ask them on your profile and answer.

**Advanced Feature: Google Local Services Ads (LSA)**

**What It Is:**
Ads that appear ABOVE your organic listing.

**How It Works:**
Pay per lead, not per click.
Google verifies lead quality.

**Cost:**
Variable by industry (typically $5-50 per lead).

**Worth It?**
Yes, if your service has high profit margins.

**When to Use:**
After optimizing organic profile. This is acceleration, not foundation.

**Weekly Metrics:**

- How many viewed your profile

**What This Tells You:**

- **Calls but no conversions:** Sales/pricing issue (not GMB problem)
