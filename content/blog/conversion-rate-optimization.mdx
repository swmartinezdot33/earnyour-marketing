# The Traffic vs. Leads Problem

You've spent money on SEO or ads. Your website is getting visitors. But the phone isn't ringing.

**Sound familiar?**

The problem isn't traffic—it's **conversion**. Your website isn't turning visitors into leads.

## Why Most Websites Don't Convert

1. **Unclear value proposition** (visitors don't know what you do)
2. **Weak call-to-action** ("Learn More" is not compelling)
3. **Too many options** (decision paralysis)
4. **Slow loading** (visitors leave before seeing content)
5. **Mobile-unfriendly** (60% of traffic is mobile)

## The CRO Framework That Works

### 1. Above the Fold Clarity

Within 3 seconds, visitors must understand:
- **What you do**
- **Who you help**
- **What action to take**

**Bad**: "Welcome to ABC Company. We've been serving customers since 1995..."

**Good**: "Emergency Plumber in Southaven. Available 24/7. Call Now: (662) 555-0123"

### 2. Single, Clear Call-to-Action

Don't give visitors 10 options. Give them **one clear path forward**:

- "Get a Free Estimate" (for service businesses)
- "Book a Consultation" (for professional services)
- "Call Now" (for emergency services)

### 3. Trust Signals Everywhere

People don't trust websites. Show them:
- **Reviews/Testimonials** (social proof)
- **Years in Business** (experience)
- **Certifications** (credibility)
- **Real Photos** (not stock images)
- **Local Address** (you're real, not a scam)

### 4. Mobile Optimization

**60% of local searches happen on mobile.** If your site doesn't work on phones, you're losing most of your traffic.

Test on actual phones, not just desktop view.

### 5. Speed Matters

**Every second of load time costs you 7% of visitors.**

- Compress images
- Minimize code
- Use fast hosting
- Enable caching

## Real Results

**HVAC Company:**
- Before: 2% conversion rate (2 leads per 100 visitors)
- After: 8% conversion rate (8 leads per 100 visitors)
- **4x improvement** with same traffic

**Dental Practice:**
- Before: 1.5% conversion rate
- After: 6% conversion rate
- **4x improvement**

## The Quick Wins (Do These First)

1. **Add phone number** (clickable, prominent)
2. **Simplify navigation** (fewer menu items)
3. **Add testimonials** (above the fold)
4. **Make CTA button bigger** (orange, contrasting color)
5. **Test on mobile** (fix what's broken)
