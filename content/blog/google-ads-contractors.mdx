# The Contractor Lead Generation Problem

Most contractors we talk to are paying $30-$50 per lead on Google Ads. Some are paying even more. That's insane when you can get the same quality leads for $5-$15.

The difference? **Strategy.**

## Why Most Contractor Ads Fail

1. **Bidding on the wrong keywords** ("plumber" vs "plumber near me")
2. **Sending traffic to the homepage** instead of a dedicated landing page
3. **Not using Local Service Ads** (LSAs) when available
4. **Ignoring negative keywords** (wasting money on irrelevant clicks)
5. **No conversion tracking** (flying blind)

## The $5 Lead Formula

### Step 1: Target High-Intent Keywords

Stop bidding on broad terms like "plumber." Instead, target:
- "emergency plumber [your city]"
- "plumber near me"
- "[service] [city] cost"
- "[service] [city] reviews"

These searchers are ready to hire.

### Step 2: Use Local Service Ads (LSAs)

If Google offers LSAs for your trade, use them. They:
- Show at the very top with a "Google Guaranteed" badge
- Only charge you for leads (not clicks)
- Pre-screen customers
- Cost less than traditional ads

### Step 3: Build Conversion-Focused Landing Pages

Your landing page needs:
- **Clear headline**: "Get a Free Estimate in 24 Hours"
- **Phone number** (clickable on mobile)
- **Simple form** (name, phone, service needed)
- **Trust signals** (reviews, certifications, years in business)
- **Fast loading** (under 2 seconds)

### Step 4: Set Up Call Tracking

Track which keywords generate phone calls. Double down on what works, cut what doesn't.

### Step 5: Retarget Website Visitors

People who visit your site but don't call are still interested. Retarget them with:
- Special offers
- Customer testimonials
- "Why Choose Us" content
