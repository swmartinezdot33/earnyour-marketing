# The Review Generation Problem

You know reviews matter. You've probably asked customers to leave reviews. But most of them don't do it.

Why? **Friction.**

Asking someone to "go to Google and search for us" adds too many steps. Most people give up.

## The Solution: Direct Review Links

Instead of asking customers to search, send them a **direct link** that opens the review box instantly.

[Use our free Review Link Generator](/tools/google-review-link-generator) to create yours.

## The Perfect Review Request Script

Here's the exact 3-step process we use for our clients:

### Step 1: The Immediate Follow-Up (SMS)

**Send within 1 hour of service completion:**

> "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing [Business Name]! We'd love to hear about your experience. Can you take 30 seconds to leave us a review? [Direct Review Link]"

**Why it works**: You're top of mind, and the link removes friction.

### Step 2: The Email Follow-Up (24 Hours Later)

**Subject**: "How did we do?"

**Body**:
> Hi [Name],
> 
> We hope you're happy with the [service] we provided yesterday.
> 
> If you have a moment, we'd really appreciate a quick review. It helps other customers find us and helps us improve.
> 
> [Leave a Review Button/Link]
> 
> Thanks!
> [Your Name]

### Step 3: The Automation (If No Review After 3 Days)

**Automated SMS**:
> "Hi [Name], we noticed you haven't left a review yet. If something wasn't perfect, please let us know directly: [Phone Number]. Otherwise, we'd love your feedback: [Review Link]"

## The Psychology Behind It

1. **Timing**: Ask immediately while the experience is fresh
2. **Ease**: Direct link removes all friction
3. **Personal**: Use their name, reference the specific service
4. **Value**: Explain why reviews help (other customers, improvement)
5. **Follow-up**: Don't give up after one ask

## Automation Tools

**GoHighLevel** (our favorite):
- Automatically sends review requests after jobs
- Tracks who left reviews
- Follows up with non-responders
- Integrates with your CRM

**Other options**: Podium, Birdeye, Reputation.com

## What Gets You Banned

**Never:**
- Pay for reviews
- Write fake reviews
- Ask employees to leave reviews
- Offer incentives for positive reviews only
- Review your own business

**Google will penalize you** if caught.

## The Results

Our clients see:
- **80%+ review conversion rate** (vs. 5-10% with manual asking)
- **Average 4.8+ star rating**
- **20-30 new reviews per month**
- **Top 3 Map Pack rankings**

## Handling Negative Reviews

**Don't ignore them.** Respond professionally:

> "Hi [Name], we're sorry to hear about your experience. We'd like to make this right. Please call us directly at [Phone] so we can resolve this."

Then take it offline. Many customers will update their review after you fix the issue.
