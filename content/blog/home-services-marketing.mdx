# Marketing for Home Service Contractors

If you're an HVAC tech, plumber, electrician, or roofer, you know that marketing is different for your industry.

You're not selling products online. You're selling **trust** and **immediate availability**.

## Why Traditional Marketing Fails for Contractors

**Billboards**: Expensive, hard to track ROI
**Radio Ads**: Expensive, reaches wrong audience
**Yellow Pages**: Dead (nobody uses them)
**Angi/HomeAdvisor**: Expensive leads, shared with competitors

## What Actually Works in 2026

### 1. Google Local Service Ads (LSAs)

**If available for your trade**, LSAs are gold:
- Show at the very top of search results
- "Google Guaranteed" badge builds trust
- Only pay for leads (not clicks)
- Pre-screened customers
- Lower cost than traditional ads

**Trades Available**: HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Roofing, Locksmiths, Garage Door, Appliance Repair

### 2. Google Maps Optimization

**75% of people never scroll past the Map Pack.**

To rank in the top 3:
- Complete Google Business Profile 100%
- Generate 3-5 reviews per month
- Post regularly (2-3x per week)
- Add photos weekly
- Respond to all reviews

### 3. Review Generation Automation

**The Problem**: Asking customers manually gets 5% conversion
**The Solution**: Automated SMS with direct review link gets 80% conversion

Set up GoHighLevel or similar to automatically request reviews after jobs.

### 4. Emergency Service Landing Pages

Create dedicated pages for:
- "Emergency [Service] [City]"
- "24/7 [Service]"
- "[Service] Near Me"

These pages convert 3x better than your homepage.

### 5. Retargeting Website Visitors

People visit your site but don't call. Retarget them with:
- Facebook/Instagram ads
- Google Display ads
- Special offers
- Customer testimonials

**Result**: 20-30% of retargeted visitors convert.

## The Contractor Marketing Stack

**Essential Tools:**
1. **Google Business Profile** (free, most important)
2. **Google Ads** (LSAs + Search Ads)
3. **Review Generation Tool** (GoHighLevel, Podium)
4. **Call Tracking** (know which ads work)
5. **CRM** (follow up with leads instantly)

**Budget**: $1,500-$3,000/month minimum to see real results.

## Real Results

**HVAC Company (Southaven):**
- Strategy: LSAs + Local SEO + Review Automation
- Result: 150+ calls per month, $18 cost per call
- **ROI: 8:1**

**Plumbing Company (Tupelo):**
- Strategy: Google Ads + Retargeting + Landing Pages
- Result: 200+ leads per month, $12 cost per lead

## Common Contractor Mistakes

1. **Relying on referrals only** (not scalable)
2. **Using Angi/HomeAdvisor** (expensive, shared leads)
3. **No website** (invisible online)
4. **Ignoring reviews** (customers check reviews first)
5. **Not tracking ROI** (don't know what's working)
