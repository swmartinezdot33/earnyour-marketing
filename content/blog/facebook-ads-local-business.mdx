# The "Boost Post" Trap

If you're a local business owner, you've probably been tempted to "boost" a Facebook post. Maybe you did it. Maybe it got you some likes. But did it get you any customers?

Probably not.

Here's why: **Boosting posts is Facebook's way of getting you to pay for engagement, not leads.**

## The Difference Between Engagement and Revenue

**Engagement** = Likes, comments, shares
**Revenue** = Phone calls, form fills, booked appointments

You need revenue, not engagement.

## How to Run Facebook Ads That Actually Work

### 1. Use Facebook Ads Manager (Not Boost)

Boost is simplified and limited. Ads Manager gives you:
- Precise targeting
- Multiple ad formats
- Conversion tracking
- A/B testing
- Retargeting options

### 2. Target by Location & Demographics

For local businesses, target:
- **Location**: Your service area (zip codes, cities, radius)
- **Age**: Your ideal customer age range
- **Interests**: Homeowners, property owners, etc.
- **Behaviors**: Recent movers, home improvement enthusiasts

### 3. Choose the Right Ad Objective

**Don't use**: "Engagement" or "Reach"
**Do use**: "Traffic" (to your website) or "Conversions" (if you have pixel set up)

### 4. Create Lead Magnets

Instead of promoting your service directly, offer:
- Free estimates
- Free consultations
- Free audits
- Free guides/checklists

Capture their info, then follow up.

### 5. Use Video When Possible

Video ads get 3x more engagement than static images. Show:
- Your team in action
- Before/after transformations
- Customer testimonials
- Your process

### 6. Retarget Website Visitors

Set up the Facebook Pixel on your website. Then retarget people who:
- Visited but didn't convert
- Viewed specific service pages
- Added items to cart (if e-commerce)

## Real Example: Dental Practice in Oxford

**Before**: Boosting posts, $200/month, zero new patients

**After**: Proper Facebook Ads campaign:
- $500/month ad spend
- 8-12 new patient consultations per month
- $42 cost per consultation
- **ROI: 10:1** (average patient value: $2,000+)

## The Budget Reality

You need at least **$500-$1,000/month** to see real results. Below that, you're just testing, not scaling.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Boosting posts** instead of running proper ads
2. **Targeting too broadly** (entire state instead of your city)
3. **No clear call-to-action** ("Learn More" is weak)
4. **Sending to homepage** instead of dedicated landing page
5. **Not tracking conversions** (how do you know if it's working?)

## When Facebook Ads Make Sense

Facebook Ads work great for:
- **Visual services** (home remodeling, dental, medical spas)
- **High-ticket services** (legal, financial, medical)
- **Brand awareness** (new businesses)
- **Retargeting** (bringing back website visitors)

They work less well for:
- **Emergency services** (people search Google, not Facebook)
- **Very local services** (plumber, electrician - use Google Ads)
