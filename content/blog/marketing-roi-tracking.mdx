# The ROI Tracking Problem

You're spending money on marketing, but you don't know what's working.

"Is it the Google Ads? The Facebook posts? The SEO? The billboard?"

**If you can't answer this, you're wasting money.**

## Why Most Businesses Don't Track ROI

1. **It seems complicated** (it's not)
2. **They don't know where to start** (we'll show you)
3. **They're afraid of the answer** (ignorance is expensive)

## The Simple ROI Formula

**ROI = (Revenue - Cost) / Cost × 100**

**Example:**
- Spent: $2,000 on Google Ads
- Generated: $10,000 in revenue
- ROI = ($10,000 - $2,000) / $2,000 × 100 = **400%**

## What to Track

### 1. Cost Per Lead (CPL)

**Formula**: Total Ad Spend / Number of Leads

**Goal**: 
- Service businesses: $10-$30 per lead
- Professional services: $50-$150 per lead

### 2. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

**Formula**: Total Marketing Cost / Number of Customers

**Goal**: 20-30% of customer lifetime value

**Example**: If customer LTV is $2,000, CPA should be $400-$600.

### 3. Conversion Rate

**Formula**: (Leads / Visitors) × 100

**Goal**:
- Website: 2-5% (good), 5-10% (great)
- Landing pages: 10-20% (good), 20%+ (great)

### 4. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Formula**: Average Sale × Repeat Purchase Rate × Average Customer Lifespan

**Example**: 
- Average job: $500
- Repeat rate: 40% (2.5 jobs per customer)
- Lifespan: 3 years
- LTV = $500 × 2.5 × 3 = **$3,750**

## How to Set Up Tracking

**Cost**: $30-$100/month

**Cost**: Free

### Step 3: Revenue Attribution

**Tools**: CRM integration, manual tracking

## The Tracking Setup Checklist

- [ ] Google Analytics installed
- [ ] Facebook Pixel installed (if running FB ads)
- [ ] Call tracking set up
- [ ] UTM parameters on all links
- [ ] CRM tracks lead source
- [ ] Monthly ROI reports scheduled

## Common Tracking Mistakes

1. **Not tracking phone calls** (60% of leads call, not fill forms)
2. **Not using UTM parameters** (can't tell which ads work)
3. **Not connecting leads to sales** (don't know true ROI)
4. **Tracking vanity metrics** (clicks, impressions don't matter)

## Real Example: Before & After

**Dental Practice:**

**Before** (No tracking):
- Spending $3,000/month on marketing
- "Getting leads" but don't know from where
- Can't optimize
- **Wasting 40% of budget**

**After** (Proper tracking):
- Know Google Ads: $1,200/month, 15 patients, $80 CPA
- Know Facebook Ads: $800/month, 8 patients, $100 CPA
- Know SEO: $1,000/month, 20 patients, $50 CPA
- **Cut Facebook Ads, doubled SEO budget**
- **Result**: Same spend, 25% more patients

## The Monthly Review Process

**Every month, review:**
1. Cost per lead by channel
2. Conversion rate by channel
3. Customer acquisition cost
4. ROI by channel
5. What to cut, what to scale

**Time required**: 30 minutes
**Value**: Saves thousands per month
