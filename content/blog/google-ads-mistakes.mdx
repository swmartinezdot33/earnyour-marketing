# The Google Ads Money Pit

You're spending $2,000/month on Google Ads. You're getting clicks. But you're not getting customers.

**What's wrong?**

Chances are, you're making one (or more) of these 7 common mistakes.

## Mistake #1: Bidding on Broad Keywords

**The Problem**: Bidding on "plumber" gets you clicks from people across the country who can't use your services.

**The Fix**: Target "plumber near me" or "plumber [your city]". These searchers are ready to hire locally.

**Result**: Lower cost-per-click, higher conversion rate.

## Mistake #2: Sending Traffic to Homepage

**The Problem**: Your homepage talks about everything. Visitors get confused and leave.

**The Fix**: Create dedicated landing pages for each service/keyword:
- `/plumbing-services`
- `/emergency-plumber`
- `/drain-cleaning`

**Result**: 3-5x higher conversion rates.

## Mistake #3: Ignoring Negative Keywords

**The Problem**: Your ad shows for irrelevant searches like "plumber salary" or "how to become a plumber."

**The Fix**: Add negative keywords:
- salary
- job
- career
- training
- school

**Result**: Stop wasting money on useless clicks.

## Mistake #4: No Conversion Tracking

**The Problem**: You don't know which keywords generate phone calls vs. just clicks.

**The Fix**: Set up:
- Call tracking (which keywords drive calls)
- Form tracking (which keywords drive form fills)
- Revenue tracking (which keywords drive sales)

**Result**: Double down on what works, cut what doesn't.

## Mistake #5: Weak Ad Copy

**The Problem**: Generic ads like "We Do Plumbing" don't stand out.

**The Fix**: Write compelling copy:
- **Headline**: Specific benefit ("24/7 Emergency Plumber")
- **Description**: Clear offer ("Free Estimates, Same-Day Service")
- **CTA**: Action-oriented ("Call Now" not "Learn More")

**Result**: Higher click-through rates, better quality score, lower costs.

## Mistake #6: Not Using Ad Extensions

**The Problem**: Your ad takes up less space, gets fewer clicks.

**The Fix**: Use all relevant extensions:
- **Sitelinks**: Link to key pages
- **Callouts**: Highlight benefits ("24/7 Service", "Free Estimates")
- **Structured Snippets**: Show services
- **Call Extension**: Direct phone number

**Result**: More real estate, more clicks, better ad rank.

## Mistake #7: Set It and Forget It

**The Problem**: You launched your campaign 6 months ago and haven't touched it since.

**The Fix**: Weekly optimization:
- Pause low-performing keywords
- Increase bids on winners
- Test new ad copy
- Add negative keywords
- Review search terms report

**Result**: Continuously improving ROI.

## The Fix Checklist

- [ ] Audit your keywords (remove broad, add local)
- [ ] Create dedicated landing pages
- [ ] Add negative keywords (at least 20-30)
- [ ] Set up conversion tracking
- [ ] Rewrite ad copy (benefit-focused)
- [ ] Enable all ad extensions
- [ ] Schedule weekly optimization time
