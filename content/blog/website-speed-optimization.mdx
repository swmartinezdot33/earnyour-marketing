# The Speed Problem

**53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load.**

If your website takes 5 seconds to load, you're losing **nearly half of your potential customers** before they even see your content.

## Why Speed Matters (Beyond User Experience)

1. **Google Rankings**: Speed is a ranking factor
2. **Mobile-First**: Google prioritizes mobile speed
3. **Conversion Rate**: Faster sites convert better
4. **Bounce Rate**: Slow sites = high bounce rates
5. **Ad Quality Score**: Slow sites = higher ad costs

## The Speed Test

Check your site speed:
- [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
- [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

**Goal**: Under 2 seconds load time, 90+ score on PageSpeed.

## Common Speed Killers

### 1. Unoptimized Images

**Problem**: Uploading 5MB photos from your phone
**Solution**: 
- Compress images (TinyPNG, ImageOptim)
- Use WebP format
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Use Next.js Image component (automatic optimization)

### 2. Too Many Plugins (WordPress)

**Problem**: Installing every plugin you find
**Solution**: 
- Audit plugins (remove unused ones)
- Use lightweight alternatives
- Consider moving to Next.js (faster by default)

### 3. No Caching

**Problem**: Every page load fetches fresh data
**Solution**:
- Enable browser caching
- Use CDN (Cloudflare, Vercel Edge)
- Cache static assets

### 4. Render-Blocking JavaScript

**Problem**: JavaScript loads before content
**Solution**:
- Defer non-critical JS
- Use async loading
- Minimize JavaScript bundles

### 5. Slow Hosting

**Problem**: Shared hosting, slow servers
**Solution**:
- Use Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages
- Edge hosting (serves from nearest location)
- Fast CDN

## The Quick Wins (Do These First)

1. **Compress images** (biggest impact, easiest fix)
2. **Enable caching** (one-click in most hosts)
3. **Minimize CSS/JS** (plugins can do this)
4. **Remove unused plugins** (WordPress)
5. **Switch to faster hosting** (if on shared hosting)

## The Technical Fixes

### For WordPress Sites:
- Install WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache
- Use a lightweight theme
- Optimize database regularly
- Consider static site generation

### For Custom Sites:
- Use Next.js or similar framework
- Implement lazy loading
- Code split JavaScript
- Use edge functions for dynamic content

## Real Impact: Before & After

**HVAC Company Website:**
- Before: 6.2 second load time
- After: 1.8 second load time
- **Result**: 40% increase in form submissions

**Dental Practice Website:**
- Before: 4.5 second load time
- After: 1.5 second load time
- **Result**: 25% increase in appointment bookings

## Mobile Speed is Critical

**60% of local searches happen on mobile.** If your site is slow on mobile, you're losing most of your traffic.

Test mobile speed specifically:
- Use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test
- Test on actual devices (not just desktop)
- Prioritize mobile optimization

## The ROI of Speed

**Investment**: $500-$2,000 (one-time optimization)
**Return**: 
- More leads (lower bounce rate)
- Better rankings (Google factor)
- Lower ad costs (better quality score)
- Higher conversions (better UX)

**Payback**: Usually within 1-2 months
