# The Challenge

CoolBreeze HVAC was a reputable local business in Austin, but they were invisible online. They relied entirely on referrals and expensive Angi leads. They wanted to own their own lead source and stop paying for shared leads.

# The Solution

We implemented a comprehensive Local Growth System:

1. **Website Overhaul**: Built a high-speed, conversion-focused website.
2. **Local SEO**: Optimized their Google Business Profile and built local citations.
3. **Google Ads**: Launched high-intent search ads for "AC Repair" keywords.
4. **Review Automation**: Automated review requests after every job.

# The Results

- **300% Increase** in organic phone calls within 6 months.
- **Top 3 Ranking** for "AC Repair Austin".
- **$2M+ Annual Revenue** run rate achieved.
