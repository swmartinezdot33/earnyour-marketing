# The Challenge

Spotless Living, a residential cleaning service in North Mississippi, delivered 5-star service but struggled to find consistent new clients. They were relying on word-of-mouth and Facebook Marketplace posts, which led to "feast or famine" months. They needed a reliable way to get high-quality bookings from homeowners who valued premium service.

# The Solution

We deployed a "High-Trust" lead generation strategy:

1.  **Google Ads (Local Service Ads)**: We launched Google Local Service Ads (LSAs) to show up at the very top of search results with the "Google Guaranteed" badge.
2.  **Conversion-Focused Landing Page**: We built a simple, fast-loading page specifically for "House Cleaning Estimates" that converted visitors at 18%.
3.  **Reputation Management**: We set up an automated SMS campaign to past clients, generating 27 new 5-star Google reviews in the first month.
4.  **Local SEO**: targeted keywords like "Maid Service Olive Branch" and "Deep Cleaning Southaven".

# The Results

-   **150% Increase** in weekly recurring bookings.
-   **Cost Per Lead** dropped to under $25.
-   **Expanded to a second crew** within 3 months to handle the demand.
