# The Challenge

Vitality Weight Loss Clinic offered a life-changing service but had trouble reaching their ideal patients. Their existing marketing was generic, and they wasted hours chasing unqualified leads who were just "kicking tires." They needed serious inquiries from people ready to commit to their health.

# The Solution

We built a "Patient Acquisition System" tailored for high-ticket medical services:

1.  **Targeted Facebook & Instagram Ads**: We ran educational video ads targeting specific demographics interested in health and wellness in the local area.
2.  **Pre-Qualification Funnel**: Instead of a simple contact form, we built a quiz funnel ("Is Medical Weight Loss Right for You?") to pre-qualify leads before they ever spoke to staff.
3.  **Instant Follow-Up Automation**: When a lead submitted the quiz, our system instantly sent a text message to book a consultation, connecting 80% of leads within 5 minutes.
4.  **CRM Integration**: All leads were synced to their practice management software for easy tracking.

# The Results

-   **50+ New Patient Consultations** booked every single month.
-   **Show Rate** improved from 40% to 75% thanks to automated reminders.
-   **30:1 ROI** on ad spend due to the high lifetime value of patients.

> "The quality of leads is night and day compared to what we tried before. The automation saves my front desk hours of work every week." - Dr. James K.
