## 📝 Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you want to spend time creating templates?
├─ YES → "Create all downloadables for me"
│   └─ I generate 10 assets (4-6 hours)
│   └─ You upload + record videos later
│
└─ NO → "I'll create the videos"
    └─ I'll coach you through recording
    └─ Takes 1-2 hours to record all 13
    └─ No editing needed
```

## ⚡ Most Important Question

**Which would add more value to YOUR students:**
- A) Templates they can copy/paste (high value, low video)
- B) Videos showing the process (medium value, more engaging)
- C) Both (best but takes longer)

**My answer: Both is ideal, but templates > videos**

Students would rather have 50 ready-to-use post ideas than watch a video about posting. The templates are the real value.

## 🎯 Decision Time

**What do you want me to create?**

Option 1: All downloadables (I do all the work)
Option 2: Specific templates (name them)
Option 3: Both downloadables + video coaching
Option 4: Something else

Let me know and I'll start immediately.
