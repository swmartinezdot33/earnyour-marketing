**Subject:** New: Google My Business Mastery Course (+ $500 in free resources)

---

Hi [Name],

I just launched something I'm really proud of: A complete Google My Business course.

Here's why I created it:

I was frustrated seeing local business owners leave money on the table. They had zero Google My Business strategy. No reviews. No posts. No visibility.

Meanwhile, their competitors were using the same free tools and getting FLOODED with leads.

So I created a course that shows you exactly what those successful competitors are doing.

**What's included:**

✅ 7 comprehensive modules
✅ 29 lessons covering everything
✅ Complete video training
✅ $500+ in free resources:
   - 50+ post ideas
   - 12-month content calendar
   - 20+ review response templates
   - Email & SMS systems
   - Industry photo guides

**What you'll be able to do:**

- Claim and optimize your Google My Business profile
- Get systematic reviews (we show you the exact system)
- Post consistently (365 days of content included)
- Dominate your local market
- Get predictable flow of leads

**Price:** Just $39 (seriously, it's cheap for the value)

### Email 2: Value Stack (Follow-up email)

**Subject:** Here's what $500+ in templates means...

---

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How long would it take a freelancer to write 50 post ideas for your business?

Probably $100-200, right?

How about a 12-month content calendar? Another $200-300.

Review templates? $75-100.

Photo guides for your industry? $50-75.

That's $500+ in resources.

And I'm including ALL of it free with the course.

Here's why:

I want you to WIN. I want your business to grow. I want you to get results.

The resources are the difference between "I learned something" and "I actually implemented and got results."

So I'm removing the friction. I'm giving you everything.

You get the education (video lessons). You get the templates (ready-to-use). You get the implementation plan (exactly what to do each week).

That's a complete course.

And it's $39.

Seriously, grab it. Thank me in 3 months when you're getting way more leads.

**Subject:** See what students are saying...

Hi [Name],

When I launched the GMC course, I honestly wasn't sure how it would land.

But the feedback from students has been incredible.

Here's what they're saying:

"This is the most practical course I've taken. Immediately started using the templates." - [Student Name], [Business Type]

"Finally, a course that gives you the actual tools to implement. Not just theory." - [Student Name], [Business Type]

"Got 5 reviews in the first month just by using the email templates. Game-changer." - [Student Name], [Business Type]

"The photo checklist is perfect for my industry. Exactly what I needed." - [Student Name], [Business Type]

If you've been on the fence, these real results from real students might push you over.
