## Module 1: Introduction to Google My Business

### Video 1.1: What is Google My Business? (5 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "What is GMB?" over your face

**Script:**

"Hey, I'm [Your Name], and if you're here, you want to get more calls, leads, and customers from Google. That's exactly what this course is about.

So what is Google My Business? It's a free tool from Google that lets YOU control how your business appears on Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Reviews. It's one of the most powerful tools available for local businesses - and most people have no idea how to use it.

Here's what's crazy: when someone searches for a business like yours near them, they see three things:
1. Your business name and rating
2. Your phone number and hours
3. Your photos and reviews

If you're not optimizing Google My Business, your competitors are eating your lunch. Literally stealing customers from you.

In this course, I'm going to show you exactly how to:
- Claim your business (if you haven't already)
- Optimize every single field
- Get more reviews (we have a proven system)
- Post content that drives traffic
- Get found by more customers

By the end of this course, you'll have a Google My Business profile that actually generates leads. Not just something that exists - something that WORKS.

And here's the best part: we're including $500+ in done-for-you templates. You get 50+ post ideas, a full year of content calendar, review response templates, and industry-specific photo guides. Everything you need to execute immediately.

So let's get started. In this first module, we're covering the foundation. By the end, you'll understand exactly why GMB matters and how it can transform your business.

Let's go!"

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- GMB = Free tool from Google
- Shows up in Search + Maps + Reviews
- Most people don't use it right
- This course fixes that
- Includes $500+ in templates

**What to Show:**
- Your face talking (30 seconds)
- Screen: Google Search showing local business results (30 seconds)
- Screen: Google Maps showing business profile (30 seconds)
- Screen: GMB interface overview (30 seconds)
- Back to you: "Let's get started!" (1 minute)

### Video 1.2: Why GMB Matters in 2026 (4 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Why GMB Matters" with growth arrow

**Script:**

"Before we dive into HOW to use Google My Business, let's talk about WHY it matters.

Here are the stats:

First: 50% of all Google searches are LOCAL searches. That means people are looking for businesses near them RIGHT NOW. If you're not showing up, someone else is getting that customer.

Second: 76% of people who search for a local business on their phone visit that business within 24 hours. That's INSANE. People are ready to buy. They just need to find you.

Third: Reviews matter. Businesses with more reviews get 5x more calls than businesses with no reviews. This is not optional.

And here's the kicker: Most of your competitors are doing this wrong. Or not doing it at all. That means you have a HUGE opportunity to stand out.

In 2026, local SEO isn't a nice-to-have. It's a MUST-HAVE. Especially if you're in service industry, retail, food, or any business with a physical location.

Think about it this way: You probably spend money on marketing, right? Google Ads, social media, maybe some local ads. But Google My Business is FREE. And it's more powerful than all of those combined because it shows up when people are actively looking for what you sell.

So here's what we're covering in this course:
- How to claim your business
- How to optimize every field
- How to get more reviews
- How to post content that drives traffic
- How to stay ahead of competitors

By the time you finish, you'll have a profile that actually generates leads. Not just a profile that exists - one that WORKS.

Let's get started!"

**Key Statistics to Show:**
- 50% of searches are local
- 76% visit within 24 hours
- 5x more calls with reviews
- GMB is FREE

**What to Show:**
- Your face talking (30 seconds)
- Screen: Google search results showing local businesses (1 minute)
- Screen: Google Maps showing reviews/ratings (1 minute)
- Screen: Business profile with lots of reviews vs. empty profile (1 minute)
- Back to you: Summary and transition to next video (30 seconds)

## Module 2: Claiming Your Business

### Video 2.1: Finding Your Business on Google (5 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "How to Find Your Business" with magnifying glass

**Script:**

"Alright, first things first: you need to claim your business on Google My Business.

Here's the process:

Step 1: Go to google.com/business. You'll see a login screen. Sign in with your Google account. Don't have one? Create one. It takes 30 seconds.

Step 2: Click 'Get started' or 'Manage your business'.

Step 3: Type your business name. Google will search for existing listings. This is important - if your business is already on Google Maps, you'll see it here.

Why might your business already be on Google? Because Google automatically creates listings from across the web - directories, websites, maps, etc. It's not always perfect, but it's usually there.

Step 4: Review the results. Look for your business name, address, and phone number. Make sure it's you.

If you see your business listed:
- Click on it
- Google will ask you to verify. Usually this is via postcard. They mail you a PIN. Enter it and boom - you're the owner.
- This takes about 2 weeks.

If you DON'T see your business:
- Click 'Create a new business'
- Enter your business name
- Enter your address
- Enter your category (this is important - we'll cover this next)
- Enter your phone number
- Enter your website
- Then you verify - same process, postcard with PIN

That's it. Once Google sends you the verification postcard and you enter the PIN, you own the listing.

I know it sounds complicated, but it's actually super simple. The hardest part is just getting through the verification process, and that's just waiting 2 weeks.

Once you're verified, everything changes. You have full control. You can add photos, respond to reviews, post content, manage messages - everything.

So let's break down the next steps."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: google.com/business (30 seconds)
- Screen: Signing in process (30 seconds)
- Screen: Searching for existing business (1 minute)
- Screen: What results look like (1 minute)
- Screen: Claiming process / Creating new listing (1 minute)
- Back to you: "Next step is verification" (30 seconds)

**Key Phrases:**
- "Three options: existing listing, new listing, or multiple locations"
- "Verification takes about 2 weeks"
- "Once verified, you have full control"

---

### Video 2.2: Claiming & Verification (4 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Verify Your Business" with checkmark

**Script:**

"So you found your business (or created a new listing). Now you need to verify it.

Here's how verification works:

Google wants to make sure you actually own the business. So they mail you a postcard with a PIN code. You enter that PIN and boom - you're verified.

Here's the process:

Step 1: After you claim the business, Google asks 'How do you want to verify?'

Your options are:
- Postcard (mail, 2-3 weeks) - Most common
- Phone (instant) - If available
- Email (instant) - If available

I recommend checking if phone or email are available. If they are, use those. If not, postcard is fine.

Step 2: If you choose postcard:
- Confirm the address where it should be sent
- Google mails it (takes 2-3 weeks)
- When it arrives, go back to your GMB account
- Enter the PIN
- Done

Step 3: If you choose phone or email:
- Google calls or emails you a code
- Enter the code
- Done immediately

Once you're verified, you see a green checkmark next to your business name. That's your badge of honor.

Now you have full access to:
- Edit your profile
- Add/edit photos
- Respond to reviews
- Post content
- Manage messages
- View insights and analytics

This is huge. This is where the real work begins.

So here's what I want you to do:
1. Go claim your business today
2. Choose your verification method
3. If postcard, wait for it to arrive
4. Once verified, come back and we'll optimize your profile

Let's go!"

**What to Show:**
- Screen: Verification options (1 minute)
- Screen: Postcard arrival (1 minute)
- Screen: Entering PIN code (30 seconds)
- Screen: Green checkmark / verified (30 seconds)
- Screen: Dashboard showing access (1 minute)
- Back to you: Call to action (30 seconds)

**Key Points:**
- "Verification proves you own the business"
- "Phone/email fastest, postcard most common"
- "Green checkmark = you're verified"
- "Now you have full control"

## Module 3: Profile Optimization

### Video 3.1: Business Name & Category (5 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Name & Category" with settings icon

**Script:**

"Now that you're verified, it's time to optimize. And we start with the most important fields: your business name and category.

Let's start with business name.

Your business name seems simple, right? Just type in what you're called. But there's a strategy here.

Here's the rule: Your business name should be your actual, legal business name. Not keywords. Not 'Best Plumber in Denver.' Just your name.

Why? Because Google penalizes keyword stuffing. If you try to game it, Google catches it and you get ranked worse.

So if your business is 'Smith Plumbing', your name is 'Smith Plumbing'. Not 'Smith Plumbing - Denver's Best Plumber'.

Now, category. This is HUGE.

Your category is how Google understands what you do. It's the first signal Google uses to show you to the right people.

When someone searches 'plumber near me', Google shows businesses with the 'Plumber' category. If you're listed as 'Hardware Store', they won't show you.

So how do you choose the right category?

Think about what customers search for when looking for YOUR business. For a plumber, it's 'plumber', 'plumbing service', 'emergency plumber'. For a salon, it's 'hair salon', 'barber', 'hairstylist'.

Google gives you options. Usually 3-5 suggestions. Pick the one that matches what people search for.

Pro tip: You can have multiple categories. Add them all. If you're a salon that also does nails, add both 'Hair Salon' and 'Nail Salon'. This helps you show up for more searches.

Here's the step-by-step:

1. Go to your GMB dashboard
2. Click 'Edit profile'
3. Click on 'Business name'
4. Make sure it's your ACTUAL business name, not keywords
5. Click on 'Category'
6. Search for categories that match your business
7. Add primary category
8. Add additional categories (up to 10)
9. Save

That's it!

Quick example: You own 'Joe's Pizza'. Don't name it 'Joe's Pizza - Best Slice in Town'. Name it 'Joe's Pizza'. Then add categories like 'Pizza Restaurant', 'Italian Restaurant', 'Takeout', 'Delivery'.

This signals to Google exactly what you do, and you'll show up in more searches.

Let's move on to the next field."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: GMB dashboard (30 seconds)
- Screen: Business name field (30 seconds)
- Screen: Category selection (1.5 minutes) - show search, selection, multiple categories
- Screen: Save button (30 seconds)
- You: Recap and next steps (1 minute)

**Key Takeaways:**
- "Use your actual business name, not keywords"
- "Category tells Google what you do"
- "Multiple categories = more visibility"
- "Match customer search terms"

### Video 3.2: Hours, Contact, Website (4 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Hours, Phone, Website" with clock icon

**Script:**

"Alright, next up: Hours, Contact Info, and Website.

These are simple but crucial. Let me show you why.

First: Hours.

When someone searches for your business on mobile, the first thing they check is 'are they open right now?' If your hours are wrong, you just lost that customer. They'll go somewhere else.

So here's what you do:

1. Go to 'Info' section
2. Click 'Hours'
3. Enter your hours - be honest
4. If you close for lunch, enter that (optional but helpful)
5. If you have different hours on different days, enter each day
6. Save

Pro tip: If you're closed certain days, still list them. Say 'Closed' for that day. Don't just omit it.

Second: Contact Info.

Your phone number and email.

Your phone number is how customers call you. Make sure it's the number you want customers calling. If you have a business line, use that. Not your personal cell.

Why? Because Google uses this number for calling metrics. They track how many people call from your GMB listing. This data helps Google rank you better.

And your email? Make it a business email if possible. gmail.com is fine, but yourname@yourbusiness.com is better.

1. Go to 'Info'
2. Click 'Contact info'
3. Enter your phone
4. Enter your email
5. Save

Third: Website.

Your website is important. It's usually the first thing Google checks to understand your business.

Make sure you enter your real website. Not a Facebook page. Not 'coming soon'. Your actual website.

If you don't have a website, you can skip this, but I'd recommend getting one. Website design is outside this course, but it matters for conversions.

1. Go to 'Info'
2. Click 'Website'
3. Enter your full URL (https://yourwebsite.com)
4. Save

That's it. These three things - hours, phone, website - are the basics that make sure customers can actually contact you.

Next, we're adding photos. This is where things get visual."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: Hours section (1 minute) - show entering multiple days
- Screen: Contact info section (1 minute) - phone and email
- Screen: Website field (30 seconds)
- Screen: Save (30 seconds)
- You: Recap (30 seconds)

**Key Points:**
- "Accurate hours = customer conversions"
- "Business phone = better metrics"
- "Website = credibility"
- "Fill these in completely"

## Module 4: Visual Assets & Photos

### Video 4.1: Photo Strategy & Setup (5 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Photo Strategy" with camera icon

**Script:**

"Photos are EVERYTHING on Google My Business.

Here's why: When someone finds your business on Google Maps, the first thing they see is your photos. Not your text. Not your reviews. Photos.

If your photos are professional and compelling, they click. They call. They visit.

If your photos are bad, dark, unprofessional? They move on to the next business.

Here's the crazy stat: Businesses with 100+ photos get 50% more calls than businesses with less than 20 photos.

So let's talk strategy.

First: What photos do you need?

Essential photos (all businesses):
- Logo
- Cover photo (hero shot of your business)
- Storefront/exterior
- Interior/workspace
- Team photo
- Work examples (before/after if applicable)

Then you add industry-specific photos. We have a complete photo checklist for your industry in your resource downloads. Check that out.

Second: Quality matters.

I'm not saying you need a professional photographer. Your smartphone camera is fine. But your photos should be:
- Clear and sharp (not blurry)
- Well-lit (good natural light)
- Professional (not messy backgrounds)
- Recent (within 6 months)

Third: Consistency.

Post 2-3 new photos per week. This keeps your profile fresh and tells Google you're active.

Fourth: What works?

- Before & After photos (show transformation)
- Team in action (humanize your business)
- Customer satisfaction shots (social proof)
- Process photos (show your work)
- Behind-the-scenes (build trust)

Fifth: How to upload.

1. Go to 'Photos' in your GMB dashboard
2. Click 'Add photos'
3. Choose from your computer
4. Add as many as you want (up to 10 at a time)
5. Add captions if you want (optional but helpful)
6. Save

That's it!

Now here's my challenge to you: Go take 20 photos of your business today. Different angles. Different times of day. Good lighting. Professional.

Then start uploading them. Start with 10. Then every week, add 2-3 more.

By month 3, you'll have 30-40 photos. By month 6, you'll have 100+. And your business will be getting way more leads.

Let's move on to the next video where I show you exactly what photos to take."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: GMB Photos section (30 seconds)
- Screen: Add photos button (30 seconds)
- Screen: Upload process (1 minute)
- Examples of good vs bad photos (1 minute)
- Screen: Photo captions (30 seconds)
- You: Challenge and recap (30 seconds)

**Key Points:**
- "Photos are the first impression"
- "100+ photos = 50% more calls"
- "Quality matters more than quantity"
- "Post 2-3 per week"
- "Industry checklist in your downloads"

### Video 4.2: What Photos to Take (4 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "What to Photograph" with checklist

**Script:**

"Okay, so you know you need photos. But WHAT photos?

I included a complete photo checklist in your downloads for your specific industry. Go download that now - it has everything you need.

But let me give you the quick version.

Essential for every business:

1. Exterior/storefront - Shows people where to find you. Well-lit. Daytime. Clean.

2. Interior/main space - Shows what your workspace looks like. Clean, professional, inviting.

3. Team photo - People buy from people. Show your team. Make them look friendly and approachable.

4. Work example - Show what you actually do. For a salon, show a cut or color. For a contractor, show a completed project. For a restaurant, show food.

5. Before & After (if applicable) - This is GOLD. Shows transformation. Proves your value.

6. Logo - Professional headshot of your logo.

Then, industry-specific:

If you're HVAC, add:
- Unit installation
- Service van
- Technician in uniform
- Maintenance work

If you're a salon, add:
- Different hairstyles
- Before & after transformations
- Product displays
- Styling process

If you're a restaurant, add:
- Signature dishes (multiple)
- Dining ambiance
- Chef/kitchen
- Happy customers eating

If you're real estate, add:
- Property exteriors (day and sunset)
- Multiple rooms
- Neighborhood shots
- Amenities

You get the idea. Your photos should tell the story of your business.

Here's my video recommendation:
1. Download the photo checklist for your industry
2. Go through each category
3. Take photos for each category (even if imperfect)
4. Upload them
5. Every week, add 2-3 more
6. Get to 100+ photos in 6 months

Pro tip: Don't wait for perfect. Good is good enough. Start uploading what you have. You can always add better photos later.

Another pro tip: Most recent photos get more visibility. So constantly add fresh photos. This tells Google you're active.

Alright, you've got the photo strategy. Next module is about getting reviews - which is where the real magic happens."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: Photo checklist (1 minute) - your industry section
- Examples of good photos from different industries (1.5 minutes)
- Screen: Uploading photos (30 seconds)
- You: Recap and next steps (30 seconds)

**Key Points:**
- "Use the photo checklist for your industry"
- "Essential + industry-specific photos"
- "Quality > Quantity"
- "2-3 new photos per week"
- "100+ photos in 6 months"

## Module 5: Reviews & Reputation Management

### Video 5.1: Why Reviews Matter (4 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Why Reviews Matter" with 5-star icon

**Script:**

"Let's talk about reviews. This might be the most important video in the entire course.

Here's the truth: Reviews are the #1 ranking factor on Google My Business.

Not photos. Not hours. Not website. REVIEWS.

Here's why:

Google's algorithm is designed to show customers the businesses OTHER customers have had the best experience with. Reviews are proof of that.

More reviews = Higher ranking = More visibility = More leads

It's that simple.

Here are the numbers:

Businesses with 4.5+ star rating get 2x more calls than 3-star businesses.

Businesses that respond to reviews get 50% more calls than businesses that ignore reviews.

Businesses with 100+ reviews rank WAY higher than businesses with 5 reviews.

And here's the kicker: 73% of customers check reviews before visiting a business.

So if you have no reviews, or bad reviews, customers are going to your competitors.

Let me be blunt: If you're not actively getting reviews right now, you're losing money. Every day. Real money.

Now, how do you get reviews?

There are bad ways and good ways.

Bad way: Hope customers review you. Spoiler alert: They won't. People don't leave reviews unless you ask.

Good way: Have a system. A PROVEN system.

That's what we're covering in the next video. We have email and SMS templates. All you do is customize them and send. Students love this.

But first, understand this: Reviews are your competitive advantage.

Your competitors probably have few or no reviews. That means if you GET reviews, you'll dominate them.

One more thing: Don't just get reviews. Respond to them. Every single review.

We have response templates in your downloads. Just match the star rating, customize the name, and post. Done.

When you respond, you show Google AND customers that you care. This increases your ranking even more.

So here's the challenge: By the end of this week, you should have a system in place to ask for reviews. By the end of the month, you should have 5+ new reviews.

Can you do that? Let's find out."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: Google My Business showing reviews (1 minute)
- Screen: High-review business vs. low-review (30 seconds)
- You: Talking through statistics (1.5 minutes)
- Screen: Response templates preview (1 minute)

**Key Stats to Display:**
- 73% check reviews before visiting
- 4.5+ rating = 2x more calls
- Response = 50% more calls
- 100+ reviews = Way better ranking

---

### Video 5.2: Getting More Reviews - Email System (5 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Get More Reviews" with email icon

**Script:**

"Alright, this is the magic bullet. This is how you get reviews.

You need a system. A proven system that actually works.

Here's what we're going to cover:

1. How to ask for reviews (the right way)
2. When to ask (timing matters)
3. What to send (we have templates)
4. How to follow up (SMS system)
5. How to track (so you know what's working)

Let's start with email.

You're going to send an email to your customers asking them to leave a review.

But here's the thing: The way you ask matters. A LOT.

If your email is formal and corporate, they ignore it. If it's too casual, they ignore it. You need to hit the sweet spot.

Here's the sweet spot:

Subject line: Something like 'Quick favor?' or 'Would you mind?'

Body: 2-3 sentences. Genuine. Warm. Not salesy.

Include your review link (we show you how to get this)

That's it.

Here's the template we recommend:

---

Subject: Quick favor? ⭐

Hi [Name],

Thanks so much for choosing us! We really appreciated working with you.

If you had a great experience, would you mind leaving a quick review on Google? It takes about 30 seconds and it really helps us out.

Here's the link: [INSERT YOUR REVIEW LINK]

Thanks,
[Your Name]
[Your Business Name]
[Phone]

---

That's it. Simple. Genuine. Works.

Now, WHEN do you send this?

Best time: 24-48 hours after they buy or get your service.

Why? Because they're still happy. They haven't forgotten about you yet.

Don't wait a week. Send it while they're thinking about you.

Here's the flow:

Customer pays → 24 hours later → You send email

That's it.

Now, what if they don't respond?

That's where SMS comes in. We'll cover that in the next video.

But first, let me show you how to get your review link.

Go to your GMB dashboard. Find 'Reviews'. Look for a link that says 'Share review link' or similar. Copy that link. That's what you put in your email.

Pro tip: Shorten that link using bit.ly or similar. Makes it look cleaner.

Now here's the action item:

1. Get your review link (right now, 1 minute)
2. Copy the template I showed you
3. Customize it with your business name and phone
4. Send it to your last 10 customers
5. Do this every time you get a customer

I'm not exaggerating: This one system can transform your business.

If you get 5-10 new reviews per month, your ranking goes way up. Your calls increase. Your revenue increases.

All from one email.

Let's go!"

**What to Show:**
- Screen: GMB Review section (30 seconds)
- Screen: Getting your review link (1 minute)
- Screen: Email template (1.5 minutes) - show the exact text
- Screen: Customizing template (1 minute)
- You: Call to action (30 seconds)

**Key Points:**
- "Email 24-48 hours after service"
- "Keep it simple and genuine"
- "2-3 sentences max"
- "Include your review link"
- "Do this for every customer"

---

### Video 5.3: Getting More Reviews - SMS Follow-up (4 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "SMS Follow-up" with text message icon

**Script:**

"Okay, so you sent an email asking for a review. Now you wait.

Some people will review immediately. Most won't. That's where SMS comes in.

3-7 days after the email, send a text message. A gentle reminder.

Here's why SMS works:

People check text messages way faster than email. Within minutes, usually. So your review request gets noticed.

It's also more personal. Feels like a friend texting, not a corporation.

Here's the SMS template:

---

Hi [Name]! Quick review? [LINK] Takes 2 min. Thanks! ⭐

---

That's it. One message. Under 160 characters.

When to send: 3-7 days after email. Best time: 7pm-9pm (people check phones then).

Pro tip: Make sure you have their phone number. You might need to collect this at purchase.

Now, what happens if they still don't review?

Don't bug them. One email, one text. That's it. If they're not going to review, they're not going to review.

Focus on the next customer.

Here's the flow:

Customer makes purchase
↓
24 hours: Send email
↓
3-7 days: Send SMS
↓
If review received: Send them a thank you message (shows you care, builds loyalty)
↓
If no review: Move on to next customer

That's your complete review-getting system.

Now, here's the power move: Do this for every customer, every time.

If you close 10 customers per month:
- Send 10 emails
- Send 10 SMS
- If you get 30% conversion rate, that's 3 reviews per month
- 3 reviews/month = 36 reviews per year
- 36 reviews per year = MASSIVE ranking improvement

That's literally how you dominate your local market.

And we included all these templates in your downloads. Just customize and send.

Next video: How to respond to those reviews."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: SMS template (30 seconds)
- Screen: How to send SMS (1 minute)
- Screen: Response rates/tracking (1 minute)
- You: Summary and next steps (1.5 minutes)

**Key Points:**
- "Send 3-7 days after email"
- "Keep SMS short (1 message)"
- "Best time: 7pm-9pm"
- "30% conversion rate is realistic"
- "Do this every time"

### Video 5.4: Responding to Reviews (4 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Respond to Reviews" with reply icon

**Script:**

"This is the often-forgotten part of review management: actually responding to reviews.

Here's the thing: When you respond to reviews, Google SEES that. And it ranks you higher.

Plus, customers see that you care. That you respond. That you're engaged. This builds loyalty and shows future customers that you take your business seriously.

So here's the system:

FIVE-STAR REVIEW:

You: 'Thank you so much, [Name]! We loved working with you and we're thrilled you had such a great experience. We hope to see you again soon!'

That's it. Grateful. Warm. Genuine.

FOUR-STAR REVIEW:

You: 'Thank you for the review, [Name]! We're so glad we could help with [whatever they mentioned]. If there's anything we could have done even better, please let us know. We'd love to earn that 5th star!'

See what we did? We're appreciative but also asking what we could improve.

THREE-STAR REVIEW:

You: '[Name], thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your business. If there's anything we could have done better, please reach out to us directly at [phone]. We're committed to improving!'

This is professional. It shows you care about feedback. And you're inviting them to tell you privately what's wrong.

TWO-STAR REVIEW:

You: 'We sincerely apologize that we didn't meet your expectations, [Name]. This is not the standard we set for ourselves. Please reach out to us at [phone] so we can understand what went wrong and make it right.'

Apologetic. Solution-focused. Urgent.

ONE-STAR REVIEW:

You: '[Name], I'm truly sorry about your experience. This is not how we do business. Please contact me personally at [phone] so we can discuss this and make it right. I appreciate you giving us the chance.'

This is personal. From you, the owner/manager. Taking responsibility. Wanting to fix it.

Now here's the timeline:

Five-star: Respond within 24 hours (but any time is fine)
Four-star: Respond within 24 hours
Three-star: Respond within 12 hours
Two-star: Respond within 6 hours
One-star: Respond within 2 hours

The worse the review, the faster you respond. This shows you care.

Here's the pro tip: Respond to EVERY review. Even the bad ones. Especially the bad ones.

Why? Because when people see you respond professionally to bad reviews, they think you're legit. They think you care. They trust you more.

We included 20+ templates in your downloads. Just find the one that matches, customize the name, and post. 30 seconds per review.

So here's your assignment:

1. Download the response templates
2. Go through your existing reviews
3. Respond to any you haven't responded to
4. From now on, respond to every review within the timeline
5. Do this forever

This one habit will change your business.

## Module 6: Posts & Engagement

### Video 6.1: Post Types That Work (4 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Post Types" with megaphone icon

**Script:**

"Now that we have reviews handled, let's talk about posts.

Posts are how you drive traffic. How you keep your profile fresh. How you stay top-of-mind.

Here's the deal: Google ranks businesses that post regularly. A business that posts 2-3 times per week ranks way higher than a business that never posts.

But it's not just about posting. It's about posting the RIGHT THINGS.

There are 5 types of posts that actually work:

Type 1: OFFERS

These are promotions. Discounts. Deals.

Example: '🎉 SPECIAL: 15% off this week! Book now: [button]'

This works because people love deals. It drives action.

Post frequency: 1-2 per week

Type 2: EDUCATION

These are tips. How-tos. Advice.

Example: '💡 PRO TIP: The best time to [action] is [when]. Here's why... [explanation]'

This works because it builds trust. Shows you know your stuff.

Post frequency: 1-2 per week

Type 3: SOCIAL PROOF

These are testimonials. Customer wins. Results.

Example: '⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ '[Amazing customer review]' - [Customer Name]. We're so grateful!'

This works because other customers seeing happy customers trust you more.

Post frequency: 1 per week

Type 4: URGENCY

These are limited-time offers. Last chance. Closing soon.

Example: '⏰ LAST CHANCE: This offer ends Friday! Only [#] spots left!'

This works because it creates action. People don't want to miss out.

Post frequency: 1-2 per week

Type 5: BEHIND-THE-SCENES

These are team photos. Office tours. Day-in-the-life.

Example: '👋 MEET THE TEAM: These amazing people make [business] great!'

This works because it humanizes your business. Builds connection.

Post frequency: 1-2 per month

Now here's the strategy:

Post 2-3 times per week. Rotate between these types.

Week 1: Education, Offer, Social Proof
Week 2: Urgency, Education, Offer
Week 3: Social Proof, Offer, Education

Mix it up. Don't post the same type every day.

Here's the most important part: We've included 50+ post ideas in your downloads. They're organized by type. Just pick one, customize with your business name, and post.

Takes 2 minutes. Literally.

Next video, I'll show you the calendar we included. Pre-written posts for the entire year. You can literally copy and paste."

### Video 6.2: Your 12-Month Posting Plan (5 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "12-Month Calendar" with calendar icon

**Script:**

"Okay, this is the game-changer.

We've included a complete 12-month content calendar in your downloads. That's 52 weeks of posts. Pre-written. Ready to customize and post.

Here's what I mean:

You download the calendar. You find the month. You find the week. You copy the post. You customize your business name. You post.

Takes 1 minute per post.

That's it.

Let me show you how to use it.

First: Open the 12-Month Content Calendar in your downloads.

Second: Find the current month. Let's say it's January. Go to January.

Third: Look at this week. You'll see 2-3 posts pre-written for this week.

Monday post: '[Pre-written post for your business type]'

You copy this. You add your business name. You post.

Same for Wednesday and Friday.

That's 3 posts this week. Done.

Next week, you do the same thing. New posts, same process.

Every month has month-specific themes. January is 'New Year' themes. February is 'Love/Valentine's' themes. December is holiday themes.

Here's the power: You never wonder what to post again.

The calendar is done. All you do is copy, customize, post.

And here's the best part: The posts are designed to work. They're based on what actually gets engagement on GMB.

So you're not guessing. You're using proven posts.

Now, should you use these posts exactly as written? You can! Or you can customize them more.

Want to make it more your style? Go for it. Change a word or two. Make it sound like you.

But the structure is already there. The strategy is already there. All you do is plug in your business info.

Here's my challenge: For the next month, use the calendar every single day.

Post on Monday. Post on Wednesday. Post on Friday. Every week.

By the end of the month, you'll have 12 posts. By the end of the year, 156 posts.

That consistency will transform your GMB ranking.

And you'll have stories to tell. 'I posted 3 times a week for a year.' That's commitment.

Your customers will see that. Google will see that. And you'll rank higher.

Let's do this."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: 12-Month Calendar download (30 seconds)
- Screen: Opening January section (30 seconds)
- Screen: Copying a post (1 minute)
- Screen: Customizing in GMB (1 minute)
- Screen: Posting to GMB (1 minute)
- You: Challenge and next steps (30 seconds)

**Key Points:**
- "Pre-written posts for 12 months"
- "Copy, customize, post (1 minute)"
- "Post 2-3 times per week"
- "156 posts in a year"
- "Transforms your ranking"

## Module 7: Q&A, Local Services Ads & Advanced

### Video 7.1: Q&A Management & Advanced Features (5 minutes)

**Thumbnail:** "Advanced Features" with settings icon

**Script:**

"Alright, we're in the advanced section now. This is the stuff that separates winners from average businesses.

First: Q&A (Questions & Answers)

Customers can ask questions about your business. You answer them. Google shows these Q&As to future customers.

This is GOLD for conversions.

Here's why: Customer is considering your business. They have a question. They see the answer on your profile. No need to call. They convert immediately.

How to use it:

1. Check your GMB dashboard for Q&A section
2. Look for unanswered questions
3. Answer them. Be helpful.
4. Answer quickly (within 24 hours is ideal)

Example:
Q: 'Do you offer rush delivery?'
A: 'Yes! Rush delivery is available for orders placed before 2pm. There's a $15 rush fee.'

See? Direct. Helpful. Drives action.

Pro tip: You can ask yourself questions. Then answer them.

What questions do customers always ask? Ask them on your profile. Answer them. Future customers see this.

Example questions:
- Do you offer financing?
- How long does it take?
- Do you guarantee your work?
- What areas do you serve?

Answer these questions on your profile. You'll get conversions.

Next: Google Local Services Ads.

This is beyond this course, but I'll give you the quick version.

Google Local Services Ads (LSA) are ads that show above your organic listing. They cost money, but they're worth it.

You pay per lead, not per click. And Google guarantees the lead quality.

If you want to fast-track your success, Google Local Services Ads are the way. But that's its own course.

Last thing: Insights.

Go to Insights in your GMB dashboard. This shows:
- How many people searched for your business
- How many people viewed your profile
- How many people clicked on your website
- How many people called you
- How many people requested directions

This data is GOLD for understanding what's working.

If people are searching for you but not viewing your profile, you need better photos or reviews.

If people are viewing your profile but not calling, your call-to-action or offer needs work.

Track this weekly. Let it guide your optimization.

Alright, we're almost done. Last video is about putting it all together."

**What to Show:**
- Screen: Q&A section (1.5 minutes)
- Screen: Answering questions (1.5 minutes)
- Screen: Insights dashboard (1.5 minutes) - show metrics
- You: Summary (30 seconds)

**Key Points:**
- "Answer all Q&As quickly"
- "Ask yourself questions"
- "Local Services Ads for fast growth"
- "Track insights weekly"
- "Let data guide optimization"

If people find you but don't call: Better photos, better offers, better call-to-action.

If people call but don't convert: That's a separate issue (sales, pricing, service).
