## 💡 BEST PRACTICES

### ✅ DO:
- Send within 24-48 hours of service completion
- Personalize with customer name
- Keep it short (email <100 words, SMS 1 message)
- Use conversational tone
- Be genuine and authentic
- Include your business name
- Use direct review links
- Follow up if no response in 3 days
- Thank them even if they don't review

### ❌ DON'T:
- Send too many emails/SMS
- Sound desperate or pushy
- Ask them to edit bad reviews
- Only ask people you're unsure about
- Use fake review services
- Ask friends/family only
- Send at midnight
- Use overly formal language
- Make it complicated to review

---

## 🔄 FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

### If Customer Didn't Review After Email:
Wait 3 days, then send SMS:

```
Hi [Name], just checking - did you get a chance to leave that review? Here's the link again: [LINK]. Takes 30 seconds! Thanks! ⭐
```

---

### If Customer Still Didn't Review:
Wait 7 days, then try different approach:

```
[Name] - We've been thinking about how to improve. Would love your feedback (good or bad!) to help us serve better. Review here: [LINK]
```

## 📈 INCENTIVE IDEAS (Use Strategically)

**These work but must be appropriate:**
- $5-10 off next service
- Free add-on service
- Entry into monthly raffle
- Free upgrade or consultation
- Loyalty points

**Better incentive phrasing:**
"Leave a review and get [reward] on your next visit" vs. "Review us and get paid"

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS TO AVOID

❌ **Never:**
- Offer money for positive reviews only
- Penalize negative reviews
- Ask customers to delete bad reviews
- Buy fake reviews
- Share customers' personal reviews without permission
- Contact customers repeatedly after no response

✅ **Instead:**
- Ask all customers to review
- Incentivize the act of reviewing (not the star rating)
- Respond professionally to all reviews
- Use reviews to improve your service

## 📋 TRACKING YOUR REVIEWS

### Keep a simple spreadsheet:
| Date Sent | Customer | Email/SMS | Reviewed? | Star Rating | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1/10 | John | Email | Yes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Mentioned quality |
| 1/11 | Sarah | Email | No | - | Send SMS 1/14 |
| 1/12 | Mike | SMS | Yes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Minor suggestion |

**Track what works best for your business.**

---

## 🎯 MONTHLY GOAL

**Set a review goal:**
- Conservative: 2-3 new reviews per month
- Moderate: 5-10 new reviews per month
- Aggressive: 15+ new reviews per month

**To achieve 10 reviews in a month:**
- Send request to 100 customers
- At 10% conversion rate = 10 reviews
- Calculate: (Monthly customers ÷ desired reviews) = how many to request
