## 📋 Quick Reference: What NOT to Video

These MUST be written guides or templates (don't waste time on videos):

❌ **Written Only:**
1. How GMB generates leads - Best as 400-word article
2. Why reviews matter - Article + statistics
3. Why posts matter - Article + data
4. NAP consistency - Guide + checklist
5. Verification process - Article + flowchart
6. Perfect descriptions - Examples + tips
7. Contact hours setup - Tips + best practices
8. Photo strategy - Calendar template
9. Review velocity strategy - Strategic document
10. Post strategy - Framework + examples
11. Attributes guide - Checklist + examples

**These work better as written content because:**
- No need to show live interface
- Students can reference easily
- Better for SEO (text is searchable)
- Easier to update
- Faster to create
